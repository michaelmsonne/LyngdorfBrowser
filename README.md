# Introduction 
Welcome to the Lyngdorf Amplifier Finder!

This project provides a small browser that enables you to find Lyngdorf amplifiers on your local network. The browser is built using C# WinForms and uses networking and web technologies to scan your network and identify any Lyngdorf Appfhiller web applications that may be running on your network.

To get started, simply start the application and the browser will scan your local network for any Lyngdorf Appfhiller web applications and display them in the browser window. If a Lyngdorf amplifier is found, it will show up in the application!

Happy browsing!
